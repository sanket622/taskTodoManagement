# Project Name

## Getting Started

You can run this project using either Docker or Node.js.

- **Using Docker**: Run `docker-compose up -d --build` to start the application on `localhost:8080`. This method eliminates the need to manually start the server.
- **Using Node.js**: Alternatively, you can start the server manually by running `node server.js`.

The API can be accessed and tested using Postman.

## Running the Project

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the project using either of the following methods:

- **Docker**: Run `docker-compose up -d --build` to start the application on `localhost:8080`.
- **Node.js**: Run `node server.js` to start the server manually.

You can then use Postman to test the API.


## I initialized the project using Docker by running the command docker-compose up -d --build, which started the application on localhost:8080. Instead of manually starting the server with node server.js, I used Docker to manage the containerized environment. The API was then accessed and tested via Postman.We can run the project using either local commands with Docker or by starting the server manually with Node.js.
